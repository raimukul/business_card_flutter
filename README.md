Digital business card serves the same purpose as the traditional one—it helps you connect with your potential clients, partners, and co-workers. They help to share your contact details in one single view.

Digital business cards are sustainable and save printing costs. Furthermore, you can also get useful insights to track sales management.

They can either be created by a mobile app or a website. There are two types of digital business cards. One is the digital business card, which you send via an email and is known as an e-business card. The second one is a QR Code based business card, which is also known as the VCard QR Code.
